# CreepJS

The purpose of this project is to shed light on weaknesses and privacy leaks among modern anti-fingerprinting extensions and browsers.

1. Detect and ignore API tampering (API lies)
2. Fingerprint lie types
3. Fingerprint extension code
4. Fingerprint browser privacy settings
5. Employ large-scale validation, but allow possible inconsistencies
6. Feature detect and fingerprint new APIs that reveal high entropy
7. Rely only on APIs that are the most difficult to spoof when generating a pure fingerprint
